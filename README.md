A.S.E.T. Industries presents the ALCOR capsule, "Advanced Landing Capsule for Orbital Rendezvous". (v. 0.9.4)

It is loosely inspired by the Apollo landing module, and uses a lightweight frame-based design with very thin walls. It is meant to be used for both single-stage and two-stage vacuum landers that fit in 2.5m+ fairings as part of an 1.25m stack. Made from the finest cardboard composite materials, no effort has been spared in making an attractive, sensible and very flimsy container for your victims pilots, packed tightly between computing and scientific hardware.

TOTAL MASS - 1880 kg!

Warranty void if subjected to atmospheric reentry, hit particularly hard or sneezed at. IVA is not complete as of this moment, but a fully IVA-landing-capable capsule is planned, a work in progress IVA is included.

You can mark up action button switches with text by entering it into the vessel description in the VAB: On a separate line type AG<number>=<text> where AG<number> is the number of action group from 0 (i.e. 10) to 9. The text is limited to 14 characters. (More won't fit on the label.)
